Here are five more user-focused scenarios for the Cat API Votes endpoints, each following a logical sequence a user would follow:

## Scenario 1: "Casual Browser Voting Session"
1. User views random cats and votes on several images they like
2. User checks their voting history
3. User realizes they made a mistake on one vote and deletes it
4. User continues voting on more images
5. User filters their votes to see only their upvotes

## Scenario 2: "Creating a Personal Cat Collection"
1. User creates a specific sub_id for their "favorite cats" collection
2. User votes positively on multiple cats they want to save
3. User retrieves all votes with their collection's sub_id
4. User removes a cat from their collection by deleting the vote
5. User checks their updated collection

## Scenario 3: "Weekly Cat Rating Contest"
1. User creates votes with a date-specific sub_id (e.g., "contest-week12")
2. User votes on multiple contest entries (some positive, some negative)
3. User retrieves all their contest votes to review
4. User changes their mind and deletes a negative vote
5. User adds a final vote before the contest ends

## Scenario 4: "Cat Breed Preference Analysis"
1. User creates votes with breed-specific sub_ids (e.g., "siamese-cats")
2. User votes on multiple cats of different breeds
3. User retrieves votes filtered by one breed sub_id
4. User compares with votes from another breed sub_id
5. User removes outlier votes that don't fit their preference pattern

## Scenario 5: "Social Sharing Cat Curation"
1. User creates votes with a sharing-specific sub_id (e.g., "share-with-friends")
2. User votes positively on cats they want to share later
3. User retrieves their curated list of shareable cats
4. User removes a few cats by deleting those votes
5. User creates a new curation with a different sub_id (e.g., "share-with-family")

Each of these represents a realistic flow of how a user might interact with the Votes API in a coherent sequence rather than isolated API calls.
