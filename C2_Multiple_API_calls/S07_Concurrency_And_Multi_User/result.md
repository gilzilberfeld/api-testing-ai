# Test Scenarios for Concurrent API Usage

## Same User Concurrent Scenarios

### Image Upload and Management Flow
1. **Rapid Sequential Upload**
   - Upload multiple images in rapid succession
   - Verify all uploads complete successfully
   - Check if rate limiting correctly throttles requests

2. **Upload-Then-Vote Pipeline**
   - Upload an image
   - Immediately attempt to vote on it before processing completes
   - Test if the API correctly handles the dependency chain

3. **Upload-Delete Race Condition**
   - Upload an image then immediately send delete request
   - Test behavior when delete request arrives before upload processing completes

4. **Parallel CRUD Operations**
   - Simultaneously upload images while retrieving vote history
   - Test if operations interfere with each other
   - Verify data consistency across simultaneous operations

5. **Pagination During Updates**
   - Retrieve paginated list of votes/images while simultaneously adding new ones
   - Check if pagination handles the changing dataset correctly

6. **Vote Sequence Integrity**
   - Submit multiple votes in quick succession
   - Test if votes are processed in correct order
   - Attempt to update votes before confirmation of previous vote

7. **Session Boundary Testing**
   - Perform operations while authentication token is about to expire
   - Test re-authentication during ongoing operations
   - Verify operations spanning authentication boundaries

8. **Transaction Isolation**
   - Upload image and add to collection simultaneously
   - Test atomic nature of related operations
   - Verify no half-completed states

## Multiple Users Concurrent Scenarios

### Competitive Resource Access
1. **Same Image Voting**
   - Multiple users voting on the same image simultaneously
   - Verify vote counts increment correctly
   - Test for race conditions in vote counting

2. **Popular Image Access Pattern**
   - Simulate viral scenario with many users accessing same image
   - Test many simultaneous votes and comments on trending content
   - Verify system handles hotspot access patterns

3. **Write/Read Conflicts**
   - One user uploads/modifies image while others attempt to access it
   - Test if readers get consistent data during writes
   - Verify proper handling of in-progress resource access

4. **Deletion During Access**
   - One user deletes image while others are accessing/voting on it
   - Test graceful handling of removed resources
   - Verify appropriate error messages for lost resources

5. **Quota Competition**
   - Multiple users approaching rate/quota limits simultaneously
   - Test if quota enforcement works correctly across users
   - Verify one user cannot impact service quality for others

### Administrative Scenarios
1. **Admin/User Concurrent Access**
   - Admin performing maintenance while users access system
   - Test privilege escalation scenarios during concurrent operations
   - Verify administrative changes propagate correctly to user operations

2. **Category/Breed Update Conflicts**
   - Admin updating categories while users are uploading/filtering
   - Test taxonomy changes during active use
   - Verify consistency of classification during updates

### Load Pattern Scenarios
1. **Burst Traffic Testing**
   - Simulate sudden spike in multiple users accessing system
   - Test handling of unexpected concurrent load
   - Verify graceful degradation if system limits reached

2. **Long-Polling Impact**
   - Some users with long-running connections while others do quick operations
   - Test if connection hogging affects other users
   - Verify resource allocation is fair across usage patterns

3. **Mixed Operation Workload**
   - Combination of reads/writes/deletes across many users
   - Test realistic mixed workload patterns
   - Verify system maintains consistency under varied pressure

### Data Consistency Verification
1. **Global Counter Accuracy**
   - Multiple users generating votes simultaneously
   - Verify vote counts, favorites, and other aggregates remain accurate
   - Test for lost updates in counters

2. **Feed Consistency**
   - Users uploading while others are viewing feeds/search results
   - Test if new content appears appropriately in feeds
   - Verify search index updates correctly during concurrent writes

3. **Cross-User Visibility Timing**
   - Measure and test how quickly one user's actions become visible to others
   - Verify expected propagation delays are consistent
   - Test cache invalidation across user contexts

These scenarios test not just the API endpoints individually, but how they behave as part of an interconnected system under concurrent use. They help identify race conditions, deadlocks, resource contention issues, and other concurrency-related problems that might not appear during sequential testing.
