# Cat API Test Scenarios Prioritized by Risk

## MUST Test Scenarios

### Same User Scenarios
1. **Upload-Then-Vote Pipeline**
   - Upload an image then immediately attempt to vote on it
   - Critical path that tests core API functionality dependencies
   - High risk of race conditions affecting data integrity

2. **Vote Sequence Integrity**
   - Submit multiple votes in quick succession
   - Ensures core voting functionality maintains data accuracy
   - Could affect overall platform integrity if votes aren't properly sequenced

### Multiple User Scenarios
1. **Same Image Voting**
   - Multiple users voting on the same image simultaneously
   - Directly impacts core functionality and data accuracy
   - High risk of lost updates and incorrect vote counts

2. **Write/Read Conflicts**
   - Users accessing/voting on images while others modify them
   - Critical for data consistency and user experience
   - Could lead to data corruption or inconsistent states

3. **Deletion During Access**
   - User deletes image while others are accessing/voting on it
   - Tests handling of removed resources during active use
   - High risk of orphaned references or system errors

## HIGH Priority Test Scenarios

### Same User Scenarios
1. **Rapid Sequential Upload**
   - Upload multiple images in rapid succession
   - Tests system's ability to handle burst traffic from single user
   - Could expose queuing or processing bottlenecks

2. **Upload-Delete Race Condition**
   - Upload an image then immediately send delete request
   - Tests robustness of state management
   - Could lead to resource leaks or orphaned data

3. **Session Boundary Testing**
   - Operations spanning authentication token expiration
   - Tests critical authentication subsystem under load
   - Security and functionality implications

### Multiple User Scenarios
1. **Global Counter Accuracy**
   - Multiple users generating votes simultaneously
   - Tests integrity of aggregate counts and statistics
   - Directly impacts data trustworthiness

2. **Quota Competition**
   - Multiple users approaching rate/quota limits simultaneously
   - Tests fairness and correctness of resource allocation
   - Could affect service quality and user experience

3. **Burst Traffic Testing**
   - Sudden spike in multiple users accessing system
   - Tests system stability under unexpected load
   - Could expose scaling or performance issues

## MEDIUM Priority Test Scenarios

### Same User Scenarios
1. **Parallel CRUD Operations**
   - Performing different operations simultaneously
   - Tests isolation between different API functionalities
   - Important for comprehensive user workflows

2. **Pagination During Updates**
   - Retrieving paginated lists while adding new items
   - Tests handling of dynamically changing datasets
   - Affects list consistency and user experience

3. **Transaction Isolation**
   - Related operations performed simultaneously
   - Tests atomicity of logically connected operations
   - Important for data consistency

### Multiple User Scenarios
1. **Popular Image Access Pattern**
   - Many users accessing same trending content
   - Tests performance under hotspot access patterns
   - Important for viral content handling

2. **Admin/User Concurrent Access**
   - Admin performing maintenance during active use
   - Tests privilege boundaries and change propagation
   - Important for operational management

3. **Feed Consistency**
   - Content uploads affecting feeds/search results
   - Tests indexing and content distribution
   - Important for content discovery

4. **Cross-User Visibility Timing**
   - How quickly actions become visible to others
   - Tests propagation delays and cache invalidation
   - Important for real-time features

## LOW Priority Test Scenarios

### Same User Scenarios
1. **Long-Polling Impact**
   - Long-running connections with simultaneous quick operations
   - Tests resource allocation fairness
   - Generally lower risk unless implementing specific real-time features

2. **Mixed Operation Workload**
   - Combination of reads/writes/deletes from same user
   - Tests general system behavior under varied usage patterns
   - Important for overall system robustness

### Multiple User Scenarios
1. **Category/Breed Update Conflicts**
   - Taxonomy changes during active use
   - Tests consistency of classification systems
   - Lower impact unless classification is core functionality

## Notes on Implementation
- "MUST" scenarios represent critical paths where failures would significantly impact data integrity or core functionality
- "HIGH" priority scenarios focus on edge cases that could cause data loss or user-visible failures
- "MEDIUM" priority scenarios typically test more complex interactions that impact user experience 
- "LOW" priority scenarios test more general system behavior and robustness

When implementing these tests, start with the "MUST" category and work downward as resources permit. For the highest risk scenarios, consider both automated testing and manual verification of results.
