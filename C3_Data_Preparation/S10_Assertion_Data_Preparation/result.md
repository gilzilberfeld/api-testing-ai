I'll help you create the expected response data for the Votes POST endpoint of the CatAPI. Let me create the response that would be returned when submitting a valid vote with the input you provided.

Based on the CatAPI documentation, when you successfully submit a vote with the required fields (image_id, value, and sub_id), the API should return a response containing a confirmation message and vote ID.

Here's the expected response data:

```json
{
  "message": "SUCCESS",
  "id": 12345678,
  "image_id": "xyz123",
  "sub_id": "user-123",
  "value": 1,
  "country_code": "US"
}
```

This response indicates:
- A success message
- A unique vote ID generated by the system
- The image_id you voted on
- Your user sub_id
- The value of your vote (1 for upvote)
- The country code where the vote was submitted from (based on your IP)

The API will maintain this vote record and associate it with both the image and your user, which can be retrieved later using the GET votes endpoint if needed.
