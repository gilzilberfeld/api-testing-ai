# Input Data for Creating a Personal Cat Collection

I'll create a sequence of API calls that would allow a user to create and manage their personal cat collection, with input data for each step in the process.

## 1. Create a User Account (if required)

```json
{
  "email": "cat.lover@example.com",
  "password": "SecureMeow123!",
  "username": "CatCollector"
}
```

## 2. Upload a Cat Image

```json
{
  "file": "[binary image data]",
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123",
  "breed_ids": "beng",
  "original_filename": "my-bengal-cat.jpg"
}
```

## 3. Create a Favorite (Add Cat to Collection)

```json
{
  "image_id": "abc123", 
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123"
}
```

## 4. Add a Vote for the Cat Image

```json
{
  "image_id": "abc123",
  "value": 1,
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123"
}
```

## 5. Add Another Cat to Collection

```json
{
  "image_id": "def456",
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123"
}
```

## 6. Add Tags to a Cat in Collection

```json
{
  "image_id": "abc123",
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123",
  "tags": ["fluffy", "orange", "playful"]
}
```

## 7. Get User's Collection (Favorites)

```json
{
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123",
  "limit": 10,
  "page": 0
}
```

## 8. Get Analysis of User's Collection (by Breed, Color, etc.)

```json
{
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123",
  "attach_breed": 1,
  "include_vote": 1
}
```

## 9. Update Category for a Cat in Collection

```json
{
  "image_id": "abc123",
  "category_id": 5,
  "sub_id": "CatCollector-123"
}
```

## 10. Remove a Cat from Collection (Delete Favorite)

```json
{
  "favourite_id": "fav12345"
}
```

Each of these API calls represents a step in the process of creating and managing a personal cat collection, with the appropriate input data formatted according to typical REST API expectations. The actual parameters may vary depending on the exact API specifications, but this sequence covers the core functionality needed for a complete cat collection management system.
