I'll help you create test input data for the Cat API's Votes POST endpoint. Let's examine each test case carefully to ensure thorough coverage.

## Submit a valid vote with all required fields

This is a basic successful case where we provide all required fields with valid values.

```json
{
  "image_id": "xyz123",
  "value": 1,
  "sub_id": "user-123" 
}
```

In this case:
- `image_id` is required and represents the image being voted on
- `value` is required and represents an upvote (1) or downvote (0)
- `sub_id` is optional but good to include for tracking who submitted the vote

## Submit vote with missing required fields

Let's test what happens when we omit required fields:

```json
{
  "sub_id": "user-123"
}
```

This should fail because it's missing both the required `image_id` and `value` fields.

## Submit vote with invalid image_id

Testing invalid IDs is important for error handling:

```json
{
  "image_id": "non_existent_id_12345",
  "value": 1,
  "sub_id": "user-123"
}
```

The API should return an error indicating the image ID doesn't exist.

## Test with very large or very small vote values

Assuming the vote value is numeric and should be 1 (upvote) or 0 (downvote), let's test boundary cases:

Very large value:
```json
{
  "image_id": "xyz123",
  "value": 999999,
  "sub_id": "user-123"
}
```

Negative value:
```json
{
  "image_id": "xyz123",
  "value": -1,
  "sub_id": "user-123"
}
```

Decimal value:
```json
{
  "image_id": "xyz123",
  "value": 0.5,
  "sub_id": "user-123"
}
```

These tests should help verify if the API properly validates the vote value range and data type.

Would you like me to add any additional test cases or expand on any of these?
