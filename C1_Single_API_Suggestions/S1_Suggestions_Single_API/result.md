I'd be happy to help you create test cases for the Cat API's Votes endpoints. Let's analyze what endpoints we might have for Votes functionality and create comprehensive test cases for each.

Based on standard REST API design patterns, the Votes endpoints in the Cat API likely include operations like creating votes, retrieving votes, and possibly deleting votes. Without seeing the specific API documentation, I'll create test cases for the typical CRUD operations you'd expect.

## Test Cases for Cat API Votes Endpoints

### 1. POST /votes (Create a vote)

**Basic Functionality Tests:**
- Submit a valid vote with all required fields
- Verify successful vote creation returns appropriate vote ID
- Verify vote is properly associated with the specified image
- Verify vote value is correctly stored (up/down or numeric value)

**Edge Cases:**
- Submit vote with missing required fields
- Submit vote with invalid image_id
- Submit vote with invalid value (outside allowed range)
- Submit duplicate vote for same user/image combination
- Test rate limiting by submitting many votes quickly
- Test with very large or very small vote values (if numeric)

**Authorization Tests:**
- Submit vote without authentication token
- Submit vote with expired token
- Submit vote with invalid token
- Test permission levels (if applicable)

### 2. GET /votes (Retrieve votes)

**Basic Functionality Tests:**
- Retrieve all votes for the authenticated user
- Verify pagination works correctly with different page sizes
- Verify votes are returned in expected order (likely chronological)
- Filter votes by image_id

**Edge Cases:**
- Request with invalid pagination parameters
- Request with non-existent filter values
- Request very large page sizes

**Authorization Tests:**
- Request votes without authentication
- Request votes for another user (should be denied or limited based on permissions)

### 3. GET /votes/{vote_id} (Retrieve specific vote)

**Basic Functionality Tests:**
- Retrieve a specific vote by ID
- Verify all expected vote data is returned

**Edge Cases:**
- Request non-existent vote ID
- Request deleted vote ID (if applicable)

**Authorization Tests:**
- Request someone else's vote (permission testing)
- Request with invalid authentication

### 4. DELETE /votes/{vote_id} (Delete a vote)

**Basic Functionality Tests:**
- Delete own vote successfully
- Verify vote is removed from database
- Verify appropriate response code

**Edge Cases:**
- Delete already deleted vote
- Delete non-existent vote
- Delete very old vote (if there are time restrictions)

**Authorization Tests:**
- Delete vote without authentication
- Delete someone else's vote
- Delete with expired token

### 5. GET /images/{image_id}/votes (Get votes for specific image)

**Basic Functionality Tests:**
- Retrieve all votes for a specific image
- Test pagination for images with many votes
- Filter by vote value (positive/negative)

**Edge Cases:**
- Request votes for image with no votes
- Request votes for non-existent image
- Test with invalid filter parameters

**Authorization Tests:**
- Test public vs. private image vote visibility
- Test with different user permission levels

These test cases should provide comprehensive coverage of the Votes functionality in the Cat API. Let me know if you'd like me to focus on any specific aspect in more detail, or if you'd like me to create actual test code for any of these scenarios!
