# Test Cases for Cat API - POST /images/upload Endpoint

## Valid Cases

- Upload valid JPEG image within size limitations
- Upload valid PNG image within size limitations
- Upload image with minimum allowed dimensions
- Upload image with maximum allowed dimensions
- Upload image with valid metadata/tags
- Upload image with optional parameters (e.g., sub_id, breed_ids)
- Upload multiple images in succession (if supported)
- Upload with proper content-type headers
- Verify successful upload returns appropriate image ID and URL
- Verify uploaded image is accessible via returned URL
- Verify image metadata is correctly stored

## Invalid Cases

### File Format Issues
- Upload file that is not an image (e.g., text file, PDF)
- Upload unsupported image format (e.g., BMP, TIFF, GIF if not supported)
- Upload corrupted image file
- Upload empty file

### Size and Dimension Issues
- Upload image exceeding maximum file size
- Upload image smaller than minimum file size (if applicable)
- Upload image with dimensions too small
- Upload image with dimensions too large
- Upload image with extreme aspect ratios
- Upload zero-byte image file

### Content Issues
- Upload image with no cat content (if API validates this)
- Upload image with inappropriate content (to test content moderation)
- Upload images with watermarks or copyright material
- Upload images with embedded metadata that might conflict with API tags

### Request Format Issues
- Upload with missing required form fields
- Upload with invalid parameter values
- Upload with malformed JSON in metadata fields
- Upload with very long tag names/values
- Upload with special characters in metadata
- Upload with duplicate tags/metadata
- Upload with missing content-type header
- Upload with incorrect content-type header

### Resource Management
- Test rate limiting by uploading many images quickly
- Upload very large batch of images (if batch upload supported)
- Upload while at quota limit (if quotas apply)

## Authentication/Authorization Cases

- Upload without authentication token
- Upload with expired token
- Upload with invalid token
- Upload with read-only token (if different permission levels exist)
- Upload with insufficient privileges
- Test token scope restrictions (if applicable)
- Upload image associated with another user's sub_id
- Test maximum uploads per timeframe per user
- Test role-based access controls (if applicable)
- Upload with token missing specific required scopes

## Advanced Testing Cases

- Upload image via multipart form data
- Upload image via base64 encoded string (if supported)
- Upload image with various EXIF data configurations
- Upload image while simulating slow network conditions
- Upload using different HTTP clients/libraries
- Verify proper handling of concurrent uploads
- Test CORS headers for browser-based uploads
- Test idempotent behavior (uploading same image twice)
- Test upload resumability (if supported for large files)
- Verify proper cleanup if upload fails mid-way
- Test integration with any CDN or storage services
- Verify any image processing (resizing, optimization) works correctly

This comprehensive test suite covers basic functionality, edge cases, security considerations, and performance aspects of the image upload endpoint. The image upload endpoint is particularly critical as it deals with user-generated content, potentially large files, and may involve complex processing workflows.
