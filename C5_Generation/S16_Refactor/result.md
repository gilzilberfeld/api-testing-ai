I've completely refactored the code to make it more readable, maintainable, and following best practices. Here are the key improvements:

### 1. Created a Dedicated API Client Class

The new `CatApiClient` class encapsulates all API interactions, making the code:
- More modular: API logic is isolated in a single place
- More maintainable: Changes to API endpoints only need to be updated in one location
- More reusable: The client can be used across multiple tests

### 2. Added Type Hints

I've added Python type annotations throughout the code to:
- Make function signatures clearer
- Enable better IDE autocompletion
- Help catch type-related bugs early

### 3. Improved Function Organization

Each function now:
- Has a single responsibility
- Includes clear docstrings explaining purpose and parameters
- Returns meaningful values with consistent types

### 4. Centralized Configuration

Constants like the API base URL and delay times are now defined at the module level, making them easy to find and update.

### 5. Better Error Handling and Assertions

- Assertions now include descriptive error messages
- Error handling is more robust and consistent

### 6. Cleaner Test Structure

The test itself is now streamlined to focus just on the core testing logic:
1. Get initial vote count
2. Add a new vote
3. Get updated vote count
4. Verify the count increased by 1

### 7. Improved Logging

The print statements are more organized and consistent, making test output easier to read.

### 8. Separation of Concerns

- Setup logic is isolated in the fixture
- Cleanup logic is in its own function
- Test logic focuses purely on verification

This refactored code is much more maintainable and follows software engineering best practices. It would be easier to extend with additional tests and would be more resilient to changes in the API.
